## justPlay - play more, plan less

justPlay is a web application that enables students to play more and plan less. We believe that there are often too many obstacles to simply play a game that requires multiple human beings to participate (Badminton, Basketball, Table Tennis, Tennis etc...). justPlay attempts to take the pain out of organizing and finding others to play with by providing an intelligent match making system that groups people together based on their availability and preferences.

More to come :)
